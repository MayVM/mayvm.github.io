                Hi! My name is May, and I am currently a first year
                IT student, working towards attaining my bachelors 
                degree at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. 
                <br><br>
                One of my biggest passions is learning new things, I 
                just absolutely love to do research, I can spend 
                countless hours deep diving into “unknown seas 
                of knowledge” and explore them to the depths. 
                Often times I also love to share the knowledge I 
                have attained with my peers, especially if I think it 
                might benefit them as well.
                <br><br>
                Another thing I absolutely love is music, it is the one thing that never fails to enlighten my mood. Music in my eyes is just such a wonderful form of art, I love listening to it, I love playing music (which is why I play the bass and electric guitar), I love going to concerts, and I love talking about music!
                <br><br>
                Aside from those two things, I am obsessed with automating things, especially in the sense of using programming to simplify/ automate otherwise boring and tedious tasks.
