                    As mentioned in my about me, I love learning and researching, so developing new skills is always something I thrive to do. 
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t look at difficult situation from one single perspective, but I like to think outside of the box, and thus, I can be fairly creative in my solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    I am very open-minded, and am very open to other people’s input and feedback, I want to know when/if I do something wrong or something could be done better. Because that means I have something I can work on, and improve upon.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m relatively profficient in Python, have 
                    some knowledge of Java am still planning 
                    on learning Rust in the near future.
                    <br><br>
                    Aside from that in terms of communication
                    I am fluent in both English and Dutch, and 
                    am very much so, willing to learn new 
                    languages.
