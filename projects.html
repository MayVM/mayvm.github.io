                    This was my first project ever, I initially created this because I was swithing a lot between MACOS and Windows, and in order to maintain to stability of my workflow it was better to have a consistent set of keybinds. The project has since been discontinued, as I use an alternative solution (I use my Mac for everything, and Parsec to access my PC).

                    This is the website you're currently visiting. This website was developed as a school project. So I can use it as a portfolio for possible future employers. I will try to keep this website up-to-date whenever I start a new project.<br>
