            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p style="margin-top: -20px">Hi! My name is May, and I am currently a first year IT student, working towards attaining my bachelors degree at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. 
            <br><br>
            One of my biggest passions is learning new things, I just absolutely love to do research, I can spend countless hours deep diving into “unknown seas of knowledge” and explore them to the depths. Often times I also love to share the knowledge I have attained with my peers, especially if I think it might benefit them as well.
                <br><br>Another thing I absolutely love is music, it is the one thing that never fails to enlighten my mood. Music in my eyes is just such a wonderful form of art, I love listening to it, I love playing music (which is why I play the bass and electric guitar), I love going to concerts, and I love talking about music!
            <br><br>
                Aside from those two things, I am obsessed with automating things, especially in the sense of using programming to simplify/ automate otherwise boring and tedious tasks.</p>

        <!-- Skill section -->
        <section id="skills" class="skills">
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p style="margin-top: -20px">I can work well in teams but thrive when I work independently. 
                <br><br>
                    As mentioned in my about me, I love learning and researching, so developing new skills is always something I thrive to do. 
                <br><br>
                    I don’t look at difficult situation from one single perspective, but I like to think outside of the box, and thus, I can be fairly creative in my solutions.
                <br><br>
                    I am very open-minded, and am very open to other people’s input and feedback, I want to know when/if I do something wrong or something could be done better. Because that means I have something I can work on, and improve upon.
                <br><br>
                    I’m relatively profficient in Python, have some knowledge of Java am still planning on learning Rust in the near future.
                <br><br>
                Aside from that in terms of communication I am fluent in both English and Dutch, and am very much so, willing to learn new languages.</p>
